# restaurant-search-app
This is a small react-native mobile app for searching restaurants around your location. This app will help you find food near you as per your search criterias
like price, distance, rating etc. This project uses the [Yelp Fusion Api](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/get_started) for fetching restaurant data.

### Future Works
- Taking orders and payments.
- In app ratings, and reviews.

## Setup?
This project uses yarn, so I would recommend installing yarn before installing the dependencies. 

### `git clone` to clone the repo
### `npm i yarn` to install yarn
### `yarn` to install project dependencies
### `yarn start` to run the expo-xli tool

## Tutorial?
The actual user experience for the app is very simple and easy to use. The user experience design was inspired by relevant food delivery apps like Doordash, Ubereats etc. So, the 
actual navigation should be pretty intuitive for most users.
